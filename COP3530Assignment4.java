/**************************************************************
 Purpose/Description: The purpose of this program is to move all the negative 
 one values found within an array to the end and do so at worst in linear time 
 and by keeping the relative order of the items in the array. I accomplished 
 this by using another array and 2 variables that would store the location of 
 the beginning and of the new array. Then, the original array being passed as a
 parameter was iterated with a for loop and if the value of the current index 
 was -1, then it was placed at the end of the new array and the variable holding
 the location for the end of the array was then decremented. If the value was
 not -1, then the value was stored at the front of the new array and the 
 variable holding the location of the start of the new array was incremented. 
 By doing so, the array is filled from both ends, and the relative order of the 
 array is maintained if the value being tested is not -1.
